Active Area for Regeneration in Liverpool City Centre
 
A thriving hub of innovation and excellence, the Knowledge Quarter sits at the epicentre of
                        Liverpool’s high-tech industries. Over £2.2 billion has been spent regenerating the area, with
                        mega projects like Paddington Village and Liverpool Science Park revolutionising the areas
                        capabilities. 
The area is home to staggering innovative technologies like nanotech and biotechnology, helping
                        Liverpool become the second-fastest-growing digital cluster in the UK. Liverpool in general is a
                        fantastic location for investment, and currently features some of the best performing postcodes
                        for rental yield in the UK. The North West is predicted to see a staggering 27% increase in
                        house prices over the next four years- that’s 7% higher than the national average. This all
                        means that there is an incredible opportunity for mammoth capital appreciation, making it a
                        dream location for investors. In addition, with one of the highest student retention rates in
                        the country, and 29,000 students in the University of Liverpool alone, ELEMENT - The Quarter
                        will be one of the most coveted and desired new builds in the entirety of Liverpool.
